# CHIP-8 Emulator
A simple CHIP-8 emulator written in C.  
**WARNING**: This emulator is still in development and maybe broken in some aspects.  
I will make this emulator more configurable to support more games, as some instructions are ambiguous and function slightly differently for some standards.

## Building
1. Clone the git repo
```
$ git clone https://github.com/DevNugget/CHIP-8-Emulator-C.git
```

2. Run the build script
```
$ cd CHIP-8-Emulator-C
$ ./build.sh
```

3. Run a CHIP 8 program
```
./chip8 <path to program>
```
